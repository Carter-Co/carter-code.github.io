            Hi! Im Abby.<br/>
            <br/>
            I dig strategy, business developement and authenic branding.
            <br/>
            I am a sucker for a slogan, particularly if that slogan supports small business or prompts discussion and debate. 
            I am a change advocate. A climate change believer and a sustainability enthusiast.
            I could listen to passionate people talk about 'their jam' all day everyday. 
            <br/>
            I believe in growth - in all aspects of personal and professional life and I understand growth and change can be unnerving.
            The older I get, the more I try to steer away from what is black or white - because the real magic is in conversations, found in the grey area in between. 
            If you want to disrupt, innovate, and find funding or partnerships - then I am in your corner. 
            <br/>
            I have always sought more than incremental change in all I have set out to achieve
            I am a passionate advocate of small businesses, regional development and innovations that support a sustainable and inclusive circular based economy, that fosters inclusivity andthe amplification of First Nations peoples.
            <br/>
            I am proud to acknowledge the Kariyarra, Ngarla and Nyamal people as the Traditional Custodians of the Port Hedland lands, where I live and work.
            <br/> 
            I extend that respect to all Aboriginal & Torres Straight Islander people of the local community and recognise their strength and resilience, their incredibly rich cultures and their continuing connection to land and waters.
            <br/>
            I pay homage to my Elders past and present through my words and actions.
            <br/>
            I am an active member of the Port Hedland and Pilbara community where I live with my family.
            <br/>
            Essentially, I love helping cool people do cool things.
            <br/>
            And if you made it this far.... thank you for being so interested! Please get in touch!
