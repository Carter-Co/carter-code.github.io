<ul>According to a global software developer survey in 2020, the vast majority of developers are the male gender, accounting for 91.5 percent of all respondents. Female developers amounted to only eight percent of all respondents, demonstrating the male-dominating reality of the software development job. </ul>
<ul>“Australian women need more equal representation in technical and coding industries”Australian Bureau of Statistics, Women in STEM in Australia Report 2017 As Code Camp Co-Founder, COO and mum of three daughters, Hayley says: if you can see it, you can be it. The technology sector in Australia is growing rapidly, but women and young girls haven’t been an equal part of that growth.  Despite a lot of media attention and great work by organisations like Code Like a Girl and Girls in Tech, research suggests that the participation rate of females in technology – in secondary and tertiary education, and in the workforce – is actually getting worse, not better.  So, the big question is: how do we change this? </ul>
    <ul>And the answer is simple... get more women in tech.</ul>
    <ul>Gender diversity in IT is a mainstream workforce development issue. Skills shortages in emerging areas are likely to result if we don’t broaden the talent pool.</ul>
    <ul>I started the She Codes program in early 2021 and holy hades, these women mean business. </ul>
    <ul>The course itself is incredible, super challengine and really difficult at times but the assistance and mentoring offered make even the most 'green' student, feel like they can achieve extrodinary outcomes. </ul>
    <ul>She Codes is on a mission to to teach women coding skills, get women into technical careers, and build communities of like-minded women. Our vision is to increase diversity in tech by inspiring 100,000 women across Australia by 2025.</ul>
    <ul>This page is a link to the lady legends that I have come to work with and admire, throughout my own Tech Education - or 'TeDucation' - journey. </ul>
    <ul>Hats off to you ladies... you are one in a million (well technically one hundred twenty-five thousand)</ul>

    Some little factoids: 
    <br>
    </ul> • The gender pay gap is not explained by women working part- time because the gap persists for those in full-time roles.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• You won’t “fix” differential retirement savings until you “fix” the full range of factors that contribute to the gender pay gap.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• The gender pay gap can’t be closed by simply paying males and females in like-for-like roles the same - occupational segregation in the form of women’s overrepresentation in less senior lower paid roles or fields and underrepresentation at senior, management and executive levels is a major factor contributing to the gender pay gap.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Numerical equality is not a solution in itself - the second half of the equation is addressing the factors that contribute to the attrition of women from the STEM workforce once they get there.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• IT Professionals Australia 2018 survey figures confirm not only a high rate of gender-based discrimination in STEM but also intersectionality as an important factor in discrimination, that is gender as a factor in other forms of discrimination such as age or race-based discrimination.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Women leave STEM because they can’t advance their careers.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Women leave STEM for the same reasons, whether or not they have children.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Bias in access to career-building activities is a key obstacle to career advancement.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Working part-time can lead to significant career penalties.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Support for reskilling as part of a broader return to work strategy is critical because of the rapid pace of change in IT.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Unconscious gender bias in workplace culture, recruitment and decision-making is widespread in STEM.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Women love the work but don’t like the work environment. Developing diversity policies and implementing management accountability for delivering them is a useful strategy for closing the gap between diversity policy and practice in the workplace.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Existing policies should be reviewed for potential indirect discrimination.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Employers should provide mandatory training for all staff on preventing sexual harassment, an effective complaints mechanism, information to assist with prevention, clear policies on prevention and prohibition of sexual harassment and sexual harassment to be treated as a workplace health and safety issue.</ul>
    <br>
    </ul>• Gender stereotyping negatively impacts women’s opportunities for advancement in STEM fields.</ul>
